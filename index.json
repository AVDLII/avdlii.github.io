[{"content":"In my previous role, my primary focus was on PostgreSQL databases, specifically in database setup, configuration, and infrastructure rather than on the SQL level. For instance, one of my tasks was establishing streaming replication between a master and two standby database servers.\nI found this work incredibly exciting. I vividly remember the satisfaction of getting streaming replication working during my first week on the job. The ability to configure a system from scratch and see it replicate an entire database from one machine to another was exhilarating!\nHowever, as you\u0026rsquo;re likely aware, working with such systems comes with its challenges.\nWhen the master server/node fails, one of the standby servers needs to take over as the new master. This process involves rebuilding the old master, which initially acts as a standby/slave before being promoted again to master. In my experience, this rebuilding process can be slow, particularly for large databases common in large enterprises. In a business environment where time is money, the extended rebuild times can pose significant challenges.\nDuring my time in this role, a former colleague introduced me to an application running on something called Kubernetes. He demonstrated a feature where intentionally destroying one of the pods resulted in its automatic replacement without manual intervention or ssh-ing inside the pods to revive it.\nComing from a database background, this experience fascinated me. And that was just the tip of the kubernetes iceberg.\nAnd into the rabbit hole I go..\n","permalink":"https://avdlii.xyz/posts/thoughts-on-kubernetes/","summary":"In my previous role, my primary focus was on PostgreSQL databases, specifically in database setup, configuration, and infrastructure rather than on the SQL level.

I can build and customize portions of my blog. I can add certain modules here and there with HTML and CSS.\nIn order to successfully launch this blog, I had to learn Hugo. The main configuration, page configuration, filesystem structure, what function every directory have, and so on.

Best of all: its free!\nGithub Actions Since I will be writing all my blog entries in my Linux command line, I have to utilize some kind of automation pipeline in order to update my Github Pages blog every time I commit an entry.\nI found this blog that have a Github Actions automation that will do just that.
