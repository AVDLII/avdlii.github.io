For instance, one of my tasks was establishing streaming replication between a master and two standby database servers.\nI found this work incredibly exciting. I vividly remember the satisfaction of getting streaming replication working during my first week on the job. The ability to configure a system from scratch and see it replicate an entire database from one machine to another was exhilarating!\nHowever, as you\u0026rsquo;re likely aware, working with such systems comes with its challenges.\nWhen the master server/node fails, one of the standby servers needs to take over as the new master. This process involves rebuilding the old master, which initially acts as a standby/slave before being promoted again to master. In my experience, this rebuilding process can be slow, particularly for large databases common in large enterprises. In a business environment where time is money, the extended rebuild times can pose significant challenges.\nDuring my time in this role, a former colleague introduced me to an application running on something called Kubernetes. He demonstrated a feature where intentionally destroying one of the pods resulted in its automatic replacement without manual intervention or ssh-ing inside the pods to revive it.\nComing from a database background, this experience fascinated me. And that was just the tip of the kubernetes iceberg.\nAnd into the rabbit hole I go..\n","permalink":"https://avdlii.xyz/posts/thoughts-on-kubernetes/","summary":"In my previous role, my primary focus was on PostgreSQL databases, specifically in database setup, configuration, and infrastructure rather than on the SQL level.
